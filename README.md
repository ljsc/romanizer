Exercise using the rules at [Binstock on Software][binstock]. These rules are
intended to be practiced to increase skill in developing OO systems. So I will
attempt to use these restrictions while developing the solution to one of the
easier Ruby Quizes. We'll use [#22][roman] on Roman numeral conversion.

The rules from the exercise are included here in short:

  1. Use only one level of indentation per method.
  2. Don’t use the ‘else’ keyword.
  3. Wrap all primitives and strings.
  4. Use only one dot per line.
  5. Don’t abbreviate names.
  6. Keep entities small, no more than 50 lines per class.
  7. Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables.
  8. Use first-class collections.
  9. Don’t use setters, getters, or properties.
